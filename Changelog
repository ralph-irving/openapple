+ Added XFree86 DGA support. Looks really nice, but it's only half done. The mouse doesn't
  work in fullscreen mode, and there is no way to control the speed, load disks, etc. I'll
  probably ditch the GTK event handling and do it all myself, since I have to do it for
  DGA. I've worked on and off (mostly off) on another 65c02 core for the last few months -
  especially in the month or so before Christmas. If that eventually gets done the speed
  should increase a bit, and hopefully I'll get rid of the emulation bugs that I suspect
  are the reason that PoP has the funny lines (still) and Multiscribe doesn't work. Of
  course I really need to fix the current 65c02 core too, because it's portable. I'm
  thinking about redoing the video again too. The rasterize stuff is ok, but I think I
  can do better.
+ It's hard to believe it's so long since I wrote anything here. I have done a few things
  between last April and now, but not that much really.

8 April 2001
+ Removed all old video generation code.

7 April 2001
+ Threw out that dhgr color mode, implemented hgr color in the rasterize function instead
  of in the draw function. Surprisingly quickly the colors were there and were correct.
  As a side effect, the display now has surprisingly authentic color fringing.
+ Implemented dhgr color the same as I did hgr. Works well.
+ The hgr mode had a few small bugs. One was manifested as flickering of scattered pixels
  in the Accolade Comics splash screens. This bug kicked my butt for about 5 hours. I
  would think a lot and try a lot of stuff out till suddenly I discovered a problem and
  *some* of the flickering would go away. Eventually got it all at 3:30 am and so I tried
  Prince of Persia, which has the problem of seemingly random segments of lines left out
  of one of the hgr screens. Those segments then flicker when the program animates using
  page flipping. I had hoped that the Accolade fixes would solve the PoP problem too.
  No such luck.
+ Speed update-- idle in basic: ~7Mhz, 80 col basic scroll: ~1.2Mhz, 40 col basic scroll: ~0.9Mhz,
  disk II reading: ~5Mhz, Graphics stuff depending on the animation method: ~2Mhz - ~4Mhz.

1 April 2001
+ Added double hires rasterized video in B&W, Added color modes for everything except hires,
  although the double hires colors don't work quite right yet.

31 March 2001
+ Added lores, double lores, and hires rasterized graphics modes -- all B&W for now. At least
  I can play Wavy Navy again... And it's faster than before: ~4Mhz on the laptop.

26 March 2001
+ Worked on improving the speed of the rasterization. Does curses-style management of "dirty"
  segments of lines. Seems to work quite well. It's still slow when there's a lot to update:
  appx. 1Mhz on my PII 300, but on average it's now faster than before.

25 March 2001
+ Added 80 column text rasterized video. This involved working out how to let the raster beam know
  when it should redraw a line because the video mode has changed. Solved the "transparent black"
  problem mentioned below. Wrote a demo program to show that the rasterization really works
  transparently when the video mode is changed.

19 March 2001
+ On the 700Mhz Duron, idle speed is ~3.5 Mhz and scrolling speed is ~1.8 Mhz, but the display
  doesn't draw quite right; Black isn't drawn so the window looks transparent.

18 March 2001
+ Implemented a first-draft rasterized video supporting only 40-column text mode. It's still quite
  slow -- the emulator slows to about 0.8-0.9 Mhz on my machine when there's a lot to update; during
  scrolling, for example. Idle speed (with just cursor blinking) is about 1.8 Mhz. It's just taking
  too long for something sitting in the incredible sensitive main instruction execution loop.

  An example of the sensitivity: Taking out the following if-statement increased the idle speed of
  of the emulation from 1.1 Mhz to the current 1.8 Mhz:

    if (0 == (raster_dot % 14))
      {
        ++bits;
        ++last;
      }

17 March 2001
+ Finished the AE Ramworks emulation supporting 1Mb bank-switched memory

14 March 2001 (0.52)
+ Fixed a stupid bug whereby the emulator crashed if X was something other than 24 or 32 bpp

11 March 2001 (0.51)
+ Repaired a decimal mode subtraction bug
+ Added 80 column, low resolution mixed mode that I overlooked before
+ Fixed the "Columns //e" problem by rebuilding the video on every mode switch (this is kinda ugly)
